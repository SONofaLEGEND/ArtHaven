This is the Landing page of the website with a welcome and a nav bar made using Bootstrap library. The Nav bar contains various links that route to various parts of the site. The page also features various basic CSS hover animations for the links and the button. The background of the page was created custom using Photoshop.

The "Get Inspired" section is the prime feature of the site which provides the artists with the starting inspiration for creating stunning art. This section is a W.I.P section but, currently it redirects to the art exploration section.

                <p>I'm Jesse from Albequerque, New Mexico. Art has been an integral part of my life since my childhood. My early memories associated with art, are the illustration of my Middle School Chemistry teacher, Mr. Walter White. He encouraged my gravitas toward but due to difficult circumstances, I was unable to pursue it. After a long time, I once again met Mr. White, and we together, started a business venture which turned dangerous and put our lives to peril. Mr. White was more than a teacher, but a father figure, who gave his life to save me. I then moved to Alaska, where the flame of art rekindled in my life. I've been an artist since then, and, created this website for aspiring artists like me, and as a dedication to my guardian angel, Mr. Walter Hartwell White. I moved back to ABQ and bought back Mr. White's house and I'm currently residing in 308, Negro Arroyo lane, ABQ.</p>
